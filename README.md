## <font size = "6"> How to Play </font>

<ul>

This game starts with a task of building a city, and your mission is to go out and explore to find tools to build it with. To do this you must sail on your boat to discover different islands which will help you acquire parts.

However, it's not that easy, some tools might not be compatible, some might not be perfect for the job. The possibilities are endless and the sky is the limit so let your imagination go wild

Put your design skills to test and come up with the best design possible.
