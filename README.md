## <font size = "6"> How to Play </font>

<ul>

This game starts with a task of building a futuristic space city, and your mission is to go out and explore to find tools to build it with. To do this you must sail on your space ship to discover different planets which will help you acquire parts.

However, it's not that easy, some tools might not be compatible, some might not be perfect for the job. The possibilities are endless and the sky is the limit so let your imagination go wild.

Put your design skills to test and come up with the best design.

# <font size = "7"> Compatibility </font>

<font size = "5"> Here are a list of different components and how the components become compatible with one another </font>

<font size = "4">

The components written in front of any component are the components that cannot be used with the components 

<br>

> Example: <br><br>
Sailing Ship - {Energy Sources : [Bio Mass, Electrical Energy], Space Airports : [warm cosmos, Galvanostat Pathway]}<br><br>
This means that "Sailing Ship" can't be used with the energy sources of "Bio Mass" and "Electrical Energy" and that it can't be used with "warm cosmos" and "Galvanostat Pathway" space airports.
